"Me","","Hey Jeff! I just got it. Just finished the snapshot; any other financials might take a bit more time (I‚Äôm doing our annual filing this week) but I think I can address all the stuff you brought up.","Jun 23, 2014, 10:54:29 AM","+19024883635","",""
"Jeff Stockhausen ","","Doesn't have to be too formal, just the highlights. ","Jun 23, 2014, 10:54:53 AM","+19024883635","",""

"Jeff Stockhausen ","","I wish that were the case, but that's something our program can't do. If it was a loan program, it generally could, but we are forced to only go from the approval date. ","Jun 23, 2014, 2:55:45 PM","+19024883635","",""
