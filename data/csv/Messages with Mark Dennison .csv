"Me","","Hey mark, just making out the deposit cheque for 8-1450 Maple. Should it be made out to Irving M Kirsch as well?","Feb 20, 2016, 4:53:11 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Mark Dennison ","","I can't accept a deposit cheque until after occupation of the suite   so date it March 1/2016.","Feb 20, 2016, 5:11:12 PM","+16047713927","",""

"Me","","Great, thank you. It looks like I'm going to be in the states for business on the 29th, so is it ok if I send my aunt over to give the cheque and collect keys?","Feb 21, 2016, 11:46:40 AM","+16047713927","",""
"Mark Dennison ","","You'll have to be the one who gets the keys.  You are the only one who can sign off on the state of the suite.  I can only give keys to someone on the lease.  And that is you.  We can do it when you return.","Feb 21, 2016, 11:48:49 AM","+16047713927","",""
"Me","","Cool, makes sense. I guess I should drop off my cheque before I leave then? Or do you mind if I bring it when I get the keys?","Feb 22, 2016, 1:01:29 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Me","","You guys have my permission to enter my apartment on March 8 to do repairs and painting. Thanks!","Mar 7, 2016, 11:05:37 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Mark Dennison ","","Cupboards done.  We replaced the lights with domes.  I put in CFL's.  They are quite bright.  As there are three bulbs per unit, you may want to pick up some 25 watt bulbs.  CFL's and dimmers don't work together.  If you want to purchase regular bulbs, I can have Nick put in a dimmer switch.  Also, when we removed the track it became obvious the ceiling will now need to be painted.  I've ordered the paint.  Should be done this time next week.  Nick is busy until Friday at the earliest.","Mar 8, 2016, 1:55:42 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Me","","Cool, thank you. I'm gone and enyo's at my aunts from Friday morning to Sunday night so if he can get it done then I'd be grateful. Let me know. ","Mar 8, 2016, 1:56:55 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Me","","Thanks for getting that stuff done. Couple questions so that I can get insurance: 
1. When was 1450 maple built?
2. When was the roof done last?
3. Do you know if it's copper wiring?
4. Is the unit wired for 100amps?","Mar 14, 2016, 5:19:53 PM","+16047713927","",""
"Me","","Hey mark! Happy Friday. You got any places opening up? My friend's wanting to move into Kits. ","Apr 15, 2016, 6:52:49 PM","+16047713927","",""
