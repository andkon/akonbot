"martinaamarsic@gmail.com","","Sounds more like an idea for gamma unless you're a millionaire who can sustain us via orders in the short term :)","May 21, 2014, 2:58:24 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
"martinaamarsic@gmail.com","","When you move to Queen and Palmerston there's pretty much a Loblaws across your street though and better yet the Trinity Bellwoods farmers market over the summer!","May 21, 2014, 2:58:24 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
"Me","","Afraid I'm not a millionaire. I guess we'll just have to give up that biz venture. And there's a farmer's market there? When?","May 21, 2014, 3:03:03 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""

"martinaamarsic@gmail.com","","Haha! Good save. I'm actually honoured that Google would buy my idea. Thank you for acting as my broker. You can now wire my the funds but cheque is ok too","May 21, 2014, 3:34:40 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
"Me","","Fine, I'll have one written up for our date. Speaking of which, Saturday is supposed to be really nice. Beers and bellwoods in the afternoon?","May 21, 2014, 4:42:59 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
"martinaamarsic@gmail.com","","Was this a date all along? Haha now I know why you're in startups - fast and to-the-point!

"martinaamarsic@gmail.com","","Haha that's cool - I've never been propositioned in that way, not sure what to make of it yet. I think you're attractive. But a large part of attraction is fluid to me as I get to know that person's personality. That takes time. So ok I believe you get what I'm saying and I also believe I have nothing to lose to find part of that out. I'm not in the city this wknd but I'm back on Thursday. If all the above works for you then we can pick up after then","May 21, 2014, 9:11:09 PM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""

If I don't do something daily I find I'm easily thrown off course. Well, from the way you're speaking, probably not but always better to set a higher standard than one that's too low in my opinion.","May 30, 2014, 10:16:48 AM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
"Me","","Absolutely. I'm the same way with movement. Even if it's just riding my bike to work I need something. And then I need to drive myself to physical exhaustion once or twice a week too haha. ","May 30, 2014, 10:25:44 AM","martinaamarsic@gmail.com","",""
