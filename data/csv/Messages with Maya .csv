"Maya ","","Having never been to Regina I feel like 'quiet' and 'relaxing' are probably accurate descriptors. My best friend has a place on lake muskoka, a tiny little cabin amongst disgusting monster cottages.

"Me","","I'm free Sunday though - and actually next week is way open for me. What's your schedule looking like?","Aug 6, 2014, 6:46:31 PM","+16472336771","",""
"Maya ","","Ok awesome Sunday is good as is every night next week except for Thursday! So your pick!","Aug 6, 2014, 7:01:36 PM","+16472336771","",""
"Me","","Lets do some Sunday drinking, like responsible adults. Same time and place? ","Aug 6, 2014, 7:04:01 PM","+16472336771","",""
"Maya ","","Done deal","Aug 6, 2014, 8:05:36 PM","+16472336771","",""

"Me","","Hey! Glad I could overcome that strike against me. I was actually convinced I wouldn’t hear from you. Thought something was the matter. Was I just reading you wrong?","Aug 14, 2014, 7:37:52 PM","+16472336771","",""
"Maya ","","Yeah, no nothing was wrong I think I was just tired and starting to think about work which is rarely a good combination. Totally see how I could have given you that impression. Didn't mean to!","Aug 15, 2014, 7:14:52 AM","+16472336771","",""
